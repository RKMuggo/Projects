# LlamaIndex for LLM Applications with RAG Paradigm

## Overview

This project showcases everything I learned from the course "LlamaIndex for LLM Applications with RAG Paradigm." The course provided a deep dive into training ChatGPT and other models with custom data, building powerful query and chat engines, and creating AI data agents. Through engaging lectures and hands-on projects, I gained practical experience while mastering the core concepts of LlamaIndex.

## Core Concepts

### Custom ChatGPT Training
I learned how to train ChatGPT on custom data sets, enabling the creation of language models tailored to specific industry needs. This process involved:
- Preparing custom datasets
- Fine-tuning ChatGPT models
- Evaluating model performance

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
The course introduced me to the RAG framework, an AI approach that combines retrieval mechanisms with generation capabilities. Key aspects included:
- Integrating external knowledge bases for up-to-date information
- Enhancing LLM responses with accurate and current data

### AI Agents
I explored the creation of smart AI data agents using LlamaIndex agents. These agents automate data tasks, optimize workflows, and build sophisticated AI applications. Skills developed include:
- Designing and deploying AI agents
- Automating repetitive data processes
- Developing applications that utilize AI agents

### Query and Chat Engines
The course provided hands-on experience in building stateful query and chat engines. I learned how to maintain conversation context and improve user experience by:
- Developing query engines that handle complex queries
- Creating chat engines with memory for enriched interactions

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language for developing models and interfaces
- **LlamaIndex:** Framework for indexing and querying custom data
- **Streamlit:** Tool for creating interactive web interfaces
- **RAG Framework:** Method for enhancing LLMs with external knowledge

By the end of this course, I became proficient in training ChatGPT on custom data, creating LLM applications, building intelligent query engines, and deploying AI data agents. I am now well-equipped to tackle challenges in the realm of large language models and LlamaIndex applications.
