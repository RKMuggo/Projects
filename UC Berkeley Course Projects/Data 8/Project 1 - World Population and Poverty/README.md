# World Population and Poverty Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores various aspects of global population and poverty using data from Gapminder. By analyzing the data, I aim to gain insights into global population trends and poverty levels. The project includes visualizations and analyses to understand the factors influencing population growth and poverty around the world.

## Data Sources
All datasets used in this project are sourced from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) and the [Systema Globalis](https://github.com/open-numbers/ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis/blob/master/README.md). These datasets provide comprehensive information on social, economic, and environmental statistics for many countries worldwide.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into several key sections:

### 1. Global Population Growth
- **Objective:** Analyze global population growth trends from 1800 to 2020.
- **Method:** Visualize population data and examine factors influencing growth rates.
- **Outcome:** Understanding long-term population processes and potential future scenarios.

### 2. Poland Population Analysis
- **Objective:** Examine the population trends in Poland from 1900 to 2020.
- **Method:** Create tables and visualizations to track population changes and growth rates.
- **Outcome:** Insights into demographic shifts in Poland over time.

### 3. Fertility and Child Mortality
- **Objective:** Investigate the relationship between fertility rates and child mortality in Poland.
- **Method:** Create scatter plots and analyze the association between these two factors.
- **Outcome:** Understanding how fertility and child mortality rates are interconnected.

### 4. Global Poverty Analysis
- **Objective:** Analyze global poverty rates and the number of people living in extreme poverty.
- **Method:** Create tables and visualizations to examine poverty data across different countries.
- **Outcome:** Insights into the distribution and trends of extreme poverty worldwide.

### 5. Detailed Poverty Analysis
- **Objective:** Identify the countries with the largest number of people living in extreme poverty.
- **Method:** Create tables and visualizations to highlight these countries.
- **Outcome:** Understanding the regions most affected by extreme poverty.

## Conclusion
The project provides valuable insights into global population and poverty trends, emphasizing the importance of data-driven approaches to understanding and addressing these complex issues. As data scientists, it's crucial to consider real-life experiences behind the data and be mindful of the historical and political contexts that shape population studies.

## Personal Experience
Working on this project has been an enlightening experience for me. I delved deep into the intricacies of global population dynamics and the pervasive issue of poverty. Here are some key takeaways from my journey:

- **Data Analysis Skills:** I honed my skills in data manipulation and visualization using Python. Working with large datasets and deriving meaningful insights has been both challenging and rewarding.
- **Understanding Global Trends:** I gained a better understanding of how historical events, economic policies, and social changes influence population growth and poverty levels. This project reinforced the importance of looking at data within its broader context.
- **Ethical Considerations:** This project highlighted the ethical responsibilities of data scientists. It made me more aware of the potential biases and political undercurrents in population studies. Moving forward, I am committed to ensuring my analyses are fair, accurate, and considerate of the lived experiences behind the data.
- **Interdisciplinary Approach:** Combining knowledge from history, economics, and social sciences enriched my analysis. It underscored the value of an interdisciplinary approach in tackling complex global issues.

Overall, this project has deepened my appreciation for the power of data in understanding and addressing global challenges. It has inspired me to continue exploring data science as a tool for social good.
