# Fine-tuning Nvidia Chatbot for Question Answering

## Project Overview

This project involves fine-tuning a pre-trained Nvidia chatbot model to enhance the performance for question-answering tasks. Leveraging a dataset of Nvidia documentation question-and-answer pairs, the project demonstrates the complete process from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and inference.

## Environment Setup and Library Imports

We begin by setting up the environment, installing necessary libraries, and importing essential modules. Key libraries used include `opendatasets`, `pandas`, `datasets`, and `transformers`. The setup also ensures GPU acceleration if available.

## Data Loading and Initial Exploration

The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame and explored to understand its structure and content. This dataset consists of question-and-answer pairs from Nvidia documentation.

## Data Preprocessing

Text data is cleaned and normalized by converting to lowercase and removing punctuation and special characters. This step ensures a consistent format for effective model training.

## Data Splitting

The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets to prevent overfitting and to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

## Tokenization and Dataset Preparation

Using Hugging Face's `transformers` library, the text data is tokenized and converted into a format suitable for training a sequence-to-sequence model. This involves creating prompts and tokenizing both questions and answers.

## Model Training

The pre-trained Nvidia chatbot model is fine-tuned using the training dataset. Training parameters such as epochs, learning rate, and batch size are specified, and the `Trainer` API is used to handle the training loop.

## Model Evaluation and Saving

After training, the model and tokenizer are saved to disk. The model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess its performance, with metrics such as evaluation loss printed for analysis.

## Testing and Inference

The fine-tuned model is used for inference by generating answers to test questions. This demonstrates the model's ability to understand and respond to questions based on its training.
