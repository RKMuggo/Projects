# Creating LLM and RAG Architecture

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to enable efficient information retrieval and question-answering from a research paper. Leveraging a research paper as the source document, the project showcases the complete process from data preprocessing to embedding generation, model training, and inference.

## Environment Setup and Library Imports

We begin by setting up the environment, installing necessary libraries, and importing essential modules. Key libraries used include `langchain`, `bitsandbytes`, `accelerate`, `langchain_community`, `sentence-transformers`, `faiss-gpu`, `pypdf`, and `transformers`. The setup also ensures GPU acceleration if available.

## Data Loading and Initial Exploration

The dataset, which is a research paper, is loaded using `PyPDFLoader` from the `langchain` library. The paper is then split into individual pages for easier processing and exploration.

## Data Preprocessing

Text data from the PDF is split into manageable chunks using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from `langchain`. This step is crucial for generating embeddings and preparing the data for retrieval tasks.

## Tokenization and Dataset Preparation

Using Hugging Face's `transformers` library, the text data is tokenized and converted into a format suitable for training a sequence-to-sequence model. This involves creating prompts and tokenizing both questions and answers.

## Embedding Generation and Storage

Embeddings for the text chunks are generated using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`. These embeddings are then stored in a FAISS vector store to enable efficient similarity search and retrieval.

## Question Answering with RAG

The project utilizes a pre-trained model, fine-tuned for question-answering tasks. By integrating the FAISS vector store with a language model, the system retrieves relevant chunks of text and generates coherent answers to user queries.
