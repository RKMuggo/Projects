# Employee Retention Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict employee attrition. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset, the objective is to identify key factors influencing employee turnover and provide actionable insights for human resources departments. Predictive analytics can help organizations develop targeted strategies to improve employee retention, ultimately reducing costs and enhancing productivity.

## Project Summary
### Data Understanding and Preprocessing
- Conducted an initial analysis to understand the dataset, visualizing distributions, and identifying key features.
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle categorical variables, scale features, and split the data into training and testing sets.

### Model Training and Evaluation
Implemented and evaluated three different classifiers to predict employee attrition:
- **Logistic Regression**: Provided a strong baseline with an accuracy of 89.4%.
- **Random Forest**: Improved the balance between precision and recall, achieving an accuracy of 87.5%.
- **Neural Networks**: Demonstrated strong performance with an accuracy of 88%, particularly excelling in identifying employees who stayed with the company.

### Model Insights
- Each model provided unique insights into the data, highlighting different aspects of employee attrition:
  - **Logistic Regression**: Offered simplicity and interpretability.
  - **Random Forest**: Provided robustness and better handling of imbalanced data.
  - **Neural Networks**: Captured complex patterns in the data, though they required more computational resources and careful tuning.

## Final Thoughts
This project successfully demonstrated the application of various machine learning techniques to a real-world problem in human resources. By comparing multiple models, I was able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and gain a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to employee attrition. These insights can help organizations develop targeted strategies to improve employee retention.

This project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in human resources and sets the foundation for further exploration and innovation in predictive analytics for employee retention.
